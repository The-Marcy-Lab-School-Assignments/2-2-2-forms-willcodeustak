# Question

Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```

to this:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer

Default browser option is to refresh and so preventDefault() is used to prevent the automatic refreshing of the page.

e.target.reset() targeting the event to reset after user activates eventlistener through action.
