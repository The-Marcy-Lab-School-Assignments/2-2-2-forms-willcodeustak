# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

You need labels for every input to assign unique identifiers to them.

That way you can select them easier throughout your code.

1. input element with the <label> tag, creates the association between the label and the input implicitly.

2. for attribute should be the same as the id of the input element. "for" attribute in the <label> tag creates a direct association between the label and a ~~form~~ input.

# Teacher Feedback

The `for` attribute will help create an association with the `id` of an `input` tag not the `form`!
